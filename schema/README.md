# JSON Schema files and CSV files

## JSON Schema

### codelist-schema.json

This repository holds `codelist-schema.json`, against which codelist CSV files are tested.

If changes are made to `codelist-schema.json`, changes may be needed to:

* [standard](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard), extensions, profiles and templates: codelist CSV files (see below)
* [standard-maintenance-scripts](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard-maintenance-scripts): `test_csv.py`

See also: [Open Data Services Codelist Schema](https://codelist-schema.readthedocs.io/latest/)

### extension-schema.json

This repository holds `extension-schema.json`, against which `extension.json` files are tested. The schema is documented in [standard_extension_template](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard_extension_template#extensionjson) â€“ except for the `testDependencies` field, which is documented in the [OCDS Development Handbook](https://ocds-standard-development-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions/), because it is only relevant to OCP-authored extensions.

If changes are made to `extension-schema.json`, changes may be needed to:

* Specifications
  * [standard](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard): `fetch_core_extensions.py` (`codelists`)
* Tools
  * CoVE: [schema.py](https://github.com/open-contracting/lib-cove-ocds/blob/main/libcoveocds/schema.py) `apply_extensions` method

  * [extension_creator](https://github.com/open-contracting/extension_creator): [`entry.js`](https://github.com/open-contracting/extension_creator/blob/gh-pages/entry.js#L125) `extension.json` line (and recompile `app.js`)
  * [extension_registry](https://github.com/open-contracting/extension_registry): `compile.py` (`name`, `description`, `documentationUrl`)
  * [extension_registry.py](https://github.com/open-contracting/extension_registry.py): `profile_builder.py` (`name`, `codelists`)
* Internal tools
  * [standard-maintenance-scripts](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard-maintenance-scripts): `test_json.py`
* Documentation dependencies

* Templates
  * [standard_extension_template](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard_extension_template): `extension.json`, [`README.md`](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard_extension_template#extensionjson)
* Profiles and extensions: `extension.json`

## CSV files

### Codelist files

If changes are made to the headers of codelist files, e.g. as a result of changes to `codelist-schema.json` (see above), changes may be needed to:

* [ocds-babel](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds-babel): `extract.py`, `translate.py`
* [ocdskit](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocdskit): `set-closed-codelist-enums` command
* [standard](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard): `fetch_currency_codelist.py`
* [standard-maintenance-scripts](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard-maintenance-scripts): `test_csv.py`, `test_json.py`

### Extension registry files

If changes are made to the registry's `extensions.csv` or `extension_versions.csv`, changes may be needed to:

* [extension_registry.py](https://github.com/open-contracting/extension_registry.py)
* [sphinxcontrib-opencontracting](https://github.com/open-contracting/sphinxcontrib-opencontracting): `opencontracting.py` `extension_registry` method and callers
* [standard](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard): `extensions.js`, `fetch_core_extensions.py`
* [standard-maintenance-scripts](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard-maintenance-scripts): `tasks.py` `download_extensions` task, `Rakefile` `uncloned` task and `core_extensions` method and callers
